Many years ago, a young man named George took his first steps towards a very successful and impactful life and career in computer science. He was very involved on campus, being part of the club volleyball team and a member of a fraternity. He also studied hard to succeed in his computer science major. He did succeed, and some day that would pay off greatly.
But George isn't studying hard only because of his belief of becoming successful one day. He is just that kind of person with great passion of writing codes.

After college, he applied to many jobs around the country. One day, he got an email back from Microsoft saying that he had got the job as a software developer. George jumped
up and down in excitement because this was his dream job all along.

George was excited to start his new job at Microsoft, but there was a catch. The company was located in Seattle. With the current pandemic with COVID-19, there was a health risk he had to 
take if he wanted to start his new career. But his passion for software development was greater and took on the challenge.
